# Hexen
Trying out Rust and [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for creative coding.

Why not [ash](https://github.com/ash-rs/ash)?  
I tried to setup ash but was intimidated by the vulkan setup I'd have to complete again. Given I want to keep it fun for myself I decided to go for wgpu instead as documentation and implementation wise this seems more developer-friendly.

## Goals
- Use compute shaders. [Exmample project](https://github.com/googlefonts/compute-shader-101).
- Implement [imgui-rs](https://github.com/imgui-rs/imgui-rs). [Example project](https://github.com/Yatekii/imgui-wgpu-rs?tab=readme-ov-file).
